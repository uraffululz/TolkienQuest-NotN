  - The rugged, open land rolls on beforee you. Will I ever see the brandywine, you
    wonder. A hundred feet in front of you a small stand of woods looms. The shade
    and shelter from the brisk wind would be welcome, but you know that you should
    hurry on. Just then you see a tall shadow dart from behind one tree trunk to another.
    Was it friend or foe -- or just your imagination?
