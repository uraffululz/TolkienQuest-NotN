  locationText:
  - The tall trees of the Chetwood stand behind you. To the north and south the ancient
    Northway runs like a rocky, dried-up river bed. You feel a little afraid to leave
    behind the familiar road but know that your mission draws you west, and that you
    must follow the path of the sun. The stories that you've heard about Trolls roaming
    the wild hills west of the Northway keep you alert.
