  locationText:
  - The stark, rocky land rolls on before you, undulating toward the horizon. From
    atop a hillock, you spy the wide road running east and west just a few miles south
    of where you are. You could travel faster along the road -- maybe even hitch a
    ride with someone -- but you might also meet the bandits who prey on the likes
    of you, a callow youth so far from home.
