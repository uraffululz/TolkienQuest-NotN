  locationText:
  - Just a league from Hobbiton, you throw all caution to the wind and run toward
    the village, calling to every Hobbit Farmer you see for help and a horse. The
    Hobbits you pass seem to think you are mad and lock their doors as you pass. The
    shallow, gently flowing stream called The Water leads to the Southeast. Numerous
    footbridges and fords make it a rather modest obstacle.
