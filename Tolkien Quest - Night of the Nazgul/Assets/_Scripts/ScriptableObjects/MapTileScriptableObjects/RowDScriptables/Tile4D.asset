  locationText:
  - The road rises and falls with the rugged land, the wind ever-whistling in your
    ears. before you, the road runs on like a tattered brown ribbon. The ruins of
    an abandoned watchtower and the earthen burial domes of the downs are the only
    breaks in the landscape. You look east and west but see no one and nothing approaching.
    The immensity of your task weighs on you, but its importance lightens your step
    and you hurry on.
