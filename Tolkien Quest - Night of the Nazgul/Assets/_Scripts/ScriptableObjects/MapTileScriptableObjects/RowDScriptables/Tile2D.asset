  - The Great East Road appears less travelled than you had thought; maybe all those
    stories you heard as a child about bandits and wandering magicians and merchants
    bustling along the route were just tales. With your home village of Bree a few
    miles behind, you begin to feel a homesickness and a sense of helplessness. You
    have been asked to do too much! Then your hand grasps for the silver dagger at
    your belt and you again feel brave and able.
