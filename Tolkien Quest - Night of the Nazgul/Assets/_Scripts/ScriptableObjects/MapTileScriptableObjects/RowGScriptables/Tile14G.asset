  locationText:
  - 'The woods give way to a small Hobbit village, Newbury. There, a friendly Halfling
    points the way to the ferry. He listens to your warnings about Black Riders, adding
    that he has heard such tales before.

    You pass through Bucklebury, where Hobbits hide behind locked doors as you pass,
    watching you closely. Skirting Buck Hill, you pass the gate at Brandy Hall, where
    a proud Hobbit named "Something-Unintelligible Buck" spins a long tale of his
    great heritage.

    The land flattens as you near the river. Ahead you spot a flat-bottomed ferry,
    apparently unattended.'
