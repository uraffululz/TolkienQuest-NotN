  - You begin to wonder if crossing the Barrow-downs was such a good idea after all.
    From within some of the tombs come eerie whistles and moans. It's just the wind,
    you say to yourself. but what about all the stories of hauntings and guarded treasures
    you heard about as a child? You come to a little grassy valley between two good-sized
    barrows. A small creature scurries from one.
