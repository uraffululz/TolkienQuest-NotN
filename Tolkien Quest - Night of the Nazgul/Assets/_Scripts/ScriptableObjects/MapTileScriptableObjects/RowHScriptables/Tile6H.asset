  - More domed burial mounds rise before you, like rough atolls in a stark sea of
    earth. You notice with a start that the heavy oaken door to the tomb just fifty
    feet ahead seems to stand ajar. Perhaps you can squeeze in and seize a treasure
    of the First Age or a magic item to speed you along! But will such a treasure
    stand unguarded?
