  - It seems you have been wandering through the Barrow-downs for days, and yet more
    ancient mounds loom before you. The urge to explore one is overtaken by the urgency
    of your mission, and you trudge westward, toward the River beyond your sight and
    smell, the River you must reach soon if you are to alert the Shire.
