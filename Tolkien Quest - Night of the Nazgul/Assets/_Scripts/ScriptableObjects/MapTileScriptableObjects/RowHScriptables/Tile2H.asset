  - Walking around and by the barrows troubles you. It's daytime -- what could happen
    to me if I did a little exploring? Besides, what about all those stories of gold
    and gems and magic swords buried with Cardolan's ancient royalty, kings and princes
    whose bones lie beneath the rounded earthen domes so nearby? Yet your mission
    requires you to hurry on.
