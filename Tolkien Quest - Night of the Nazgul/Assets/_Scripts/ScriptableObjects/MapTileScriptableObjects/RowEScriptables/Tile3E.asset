  - More barren barrows and hillocks stretch before you as far as the eye can see.
    You have never seen such an eerie lonesome place. The broken hedge wall and withering
    trees that stand south of a Road add to your sense of foreboding. But your weapon
    and your mission give you courage. The prominent burial mound just ahead looks
    promising -- maybe it holds a great treasure. But can you spare the time?
