  - You stand at the northern edge of the Barrow-downs; seemingly endless ridges stretch
    before you as far as the eye can see. All the childhood horror stories your grandparents
    told you about the haunted ruins run through your mind, and the sun seems to accompany
    you. You spy in the distance --perhaps a mile to the South -- the ruins of a small
    castle atop a hillock.
