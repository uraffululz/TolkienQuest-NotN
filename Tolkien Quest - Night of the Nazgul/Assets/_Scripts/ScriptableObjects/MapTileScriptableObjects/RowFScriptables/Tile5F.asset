  - An unearthly, blood-chilling cry stops you in your tracks. You come upon a great
    barrow with a standing ring of earth surrounding it. Could this be the burial
    tomb of a First Age Prince? What great treasures might it hold? Perhaps you might
    claim some magic item to speed you on your mission. You approach warily, sneaking
    up to the entrance. Your heart races in your chest as the wail rises again, raising
    a ghastly warning against all intruders.
