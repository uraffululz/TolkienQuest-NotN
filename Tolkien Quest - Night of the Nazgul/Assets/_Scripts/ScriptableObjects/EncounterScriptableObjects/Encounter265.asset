  encounterText:
  - Back at the table, you eat heartily, telling Tom and Goldberry of your acventures
    thus far. They seem inpressed and interested, showing no surprise at anything
    you have to say. After the meal, you decline their offer to stay longer. <i>All
    of your damage taken, disease or any other problems are magically cured.</i>
  - '"I must hurry on," you explain. "Time is working against me and for my enemies."

    Goldberry leaves for a moment and returns carrying one of teh items you saw in
    the wother room: the small, simple bowl.

    "This is for your," she says, her merry eyes dancing. She seems amused by your
    indecision. "You will never to hungry if you carry this bowl, for it provides
    one meal a day, every day," she explains.'
