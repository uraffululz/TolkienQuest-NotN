  encounterText:
  - 'You come to your senses, dazed and battered and bleeding. The faceless, fire-eyed
    rider hovers over you, his icy blade at your throat, only his gloves and boots
    visible.

    "Talk now -- or die! Where is Baggins? Where is the Hobbit with the Ring?" he
    demands in a voice that lacks the warmth of life.'
  - "Chilled and shivering with fear and cold, your teeth clattering in your head,
    you feel his will overwhelming yours. As if from a great distance, you hear a
    \nvoice -- can it be yours? -- telling him everything.\nThe Rider raises his sword,
    threatening the final blow; you pass out, the raised blade your last sight."
