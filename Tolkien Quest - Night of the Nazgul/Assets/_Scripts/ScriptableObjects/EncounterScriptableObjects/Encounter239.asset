  - A throbbing in your skull brings you to consciousness. Your vision is clouded,
    your limbs are so weary that you can barely rise to your feet. With a start, ou
    realize that you've been beaten, robbed and left for dead. You have nothing left
    but your clothesand your wits.
  - All around you stand tall trees blocking your way out. Nothing looks familiar.
    You are lost.
