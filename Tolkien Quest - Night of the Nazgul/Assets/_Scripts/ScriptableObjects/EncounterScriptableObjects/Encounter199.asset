  - The heat inside your head sets your ears aflame; as if from a great distance,
    a faint image approaches, growing sharper by the second. In the vision filling
    your mind, a hirsute hermit speaks confidentialy with the Ranger you met in Bree,
    the man called Strider. They smile and embrace before parting.
  - You emerge from the vision feeling refreshed and relaxed. You confidently march
    deeper into the woods until you stumble upon a house of thatch built into a small
    hill, all but hidden by vines and shrubs. You call but no one answers.
