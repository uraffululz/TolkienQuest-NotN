  - Your legs grow weary; your eyes fill with tears of guilt. You ahve stolen from
    Tom zbombadil! You stumble and fall, hurting your knee. When you look up, there
    stands Tom bombadil, hands on hips.
  - '"What a young fool you are!" he says cooly. "I will have what is mine."

    You return what yoyu stole with no thought of fighting or challengin him.

    "You had betterr learn how to treat your friends," Tom says, "or you will have
    none."
