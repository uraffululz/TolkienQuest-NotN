  - A creak down the main hallway leads you cautiously toward the kitchen, now covered
    in dust. A movement catches your eye; you draw your dagger upon what you now see
    to be a beggar in rags huddled in darkness beside the stove. He babbles about
    doom and darkness and the coming of storms of fire. Sorry for the man, you give
    him what food you can spare.
