  encounterText:
  - 'The Hobbit takes you to an inn with the surprising name of the Crippled Hag.
    There you are introduced to a tall, lean man wearing light armor and sporting
    a long sword and a knife. When he grasps your hand to greet you, he squeezes so
    hard that you have to grit your teeth or scream out "Stop!"

    The man invites you to be seated, handing the Hobbit a handful of copper pieces.'
  - '"Well," he begins, "tell me all about it. Would you like some ale?"'
