  encounterText:
  - Your voice grows weary with calling out. Will no one ever come, you wonder, panicked.
    Your heart races; you prowl the trap like a beast.
  - After three hours of captivity, the sound of approaching boots rap across the
    floor above you. "Huh! What have we here?" a gruff voice calls out. You look up
    at the large, hairy head of a man twice your size. "Who are you?" he roars. "What
    do you want?"
  - You make up a name and give it to him. You say, "I am just a traveller without
    work or home. I got lost and my greed for gold led me to this trap."
  - '"Have you money?" he shouts. You nod. "How much?"

    "Just two silver pieces," you lie.

    The man scratches his whiskers, considering the deal.

    "All right. I will get you out. Toss up the silver."

    You shake your head. "You pull me up first. Then I''ll pay you."'
  - 'The man growls but relents, tossing down a rope. You wonder if this is how he
    makes a living. You grab the rope and pull yourself up.

    "Now pay up!" he demands, grabbing you by the shoulders. He appears unarmed.'
