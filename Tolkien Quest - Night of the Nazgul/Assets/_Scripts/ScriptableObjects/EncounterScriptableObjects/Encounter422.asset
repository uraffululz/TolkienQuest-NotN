  - You stand perplexed and your heart weakens as you gaze along the streets of the
    deserted town. The only sounds are those of your own pounding heart and the cool,
    hard wind that whips the shutters of Scary's grey-stone houses. All the townsfolk
    are gone, some without care to the fires in their hearths. You are too late to
    warn Scary.
