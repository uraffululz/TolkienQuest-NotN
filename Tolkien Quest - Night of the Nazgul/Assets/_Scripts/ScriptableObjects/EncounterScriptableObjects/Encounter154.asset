  - You awaken groggy and sore. Sitting up, you see that all of your possessions are
    gone and that you have been dragged into the woods east of the Ferry landing.
    By luck, you find two of your meals underr a shrub and further familiar-looking
    silver dagger. Dazed, you resolve to hurry as best you can to complete your mission
    in time.
