  - 'You awaken dizzy, covered in jewels and chained to a stone table. Above you the
    deathly song of the Wight echoes in your ears.

    <i>Cold be the hand and heart and bone

    and cold be sleep under stone</i>'
  - The Wight's song trails off as he shuts the heavy door behind him. You have never
    felt so cold and afraid; you struggle to escape from your chains and call for
    help.
