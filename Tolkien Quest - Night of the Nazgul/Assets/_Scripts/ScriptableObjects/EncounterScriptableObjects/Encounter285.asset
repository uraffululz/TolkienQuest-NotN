  encounterText:
  - On hand and knees, you make your way to the bridge and begin to scoot across,
    keeping near an edge. You have gone but fifty feet when a rider enclosed in black
    garb races at you from across the Bridge and pulls up ten feet in front of you,
    his great black steed rearing in your face. You crouch, set to spring into action.
