  encounterText:
  - 'You find yourself on the stone threshold of an ancient, illuminated house natural
    as the woods surrounding it and sturdy as a structure can be. The place seems
    timeless.

    "Come in," says Tom, "meet Fair Lady Goldberry!"'
  - In the long, low-ceilinged room you see Goldberry, the River-daughter -- a golden-haired
    maiden in a long green gown shot through with silver like dew -- smiling to greet
    you. She appears to be wearing living flowers. Stunned, you cannot manage to speak
    a word.
  - '"Fear nothing," says Goldberry, taking your hand. "You are under the roof of
    Old Tom Bombadil now."

    She leads you to a long table laden with pitchers of cream and bowls of honeycomb,
    thick bread and yellow butter, milk, cheese, green herbs and ripe red berries.
    Your mouth waters.'
  - '"First wash the weariness off, young friend," Tom cries, just as you sit down
    to attack the bread and butter. Tom leads you out a doorway, down a short passage
    and, after a sharp turn, to a low room with a sloping roof. The walls are stone,
    smooth and old, and covered with mats and curtains; the floor is of flagstone.
    In one corner lies a pile of mattresses.'
  - 'Tom points to a basin of water, leaving you to wash off the grime of your journey.
    On top of one mattress you spy three small items: a wand carved from hazelwood,
    an empty wooden bowl and a simple flute.'
