  - 'You stumble and fall, almost knocking yourself out. The heavy club of the Troll
    falls again and again against your beak. All is black.

    You awaken senseless, dazed and chained, a Troll standing guard over you. For
    a moment, you feel too weak to move. Then, as the Troll leaves to join his fellows
    at the fire, you resolve to escape.'
