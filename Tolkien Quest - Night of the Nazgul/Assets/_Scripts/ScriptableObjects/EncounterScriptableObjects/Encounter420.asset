  - 'As you pause to drink from a stream, you hear a small noise behind you. Spinning
    about, you face a man with a large club raised to strike you. As you draw your
    weapon and prepare for combat, you hear a voice behind you say,

    "You are quick, but not quick enough."

    That is the last sound you hear, as you feel a sickening blow to your skull.'
