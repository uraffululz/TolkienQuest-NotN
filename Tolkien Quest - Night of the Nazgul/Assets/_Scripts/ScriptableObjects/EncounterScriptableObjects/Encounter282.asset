  encounterText:
  - From your hiding place beside the road, you peer up at the Bridge, which seems
    deserted. Then the clop-clop of a horse's hooves alerts you. You duck into a small
    hollow and lie flat as the sound of the hourse comes nearer. Through the grass
    and above the tangled roots of a tree, you see a large black horse approaching;
    atop it sits a broad man's figure wrapped in a black hood and cloak, his shiny
    black boots visible in the stirrups. The hood covers the man's face completely
    -- if he is a man.
  - You freeze, a chill coursing through you. The horse stops at the eastern end of
    the Bridge; you see the rider bow his head, as if listening for the slightest
    sound. You hold yourbreath. Then from inside the hood a sniffing sound everges
    -- the 'man' is trying to catch your scent, you realize. Perspiration makes you
    shiver with fear.
