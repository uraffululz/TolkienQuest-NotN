  encounterText:
  - 'At the Hobbling Halfling, an ale house run by Haling Halbut, a hirsute but hapless
    Hobbit, you meet Hamfast Gamgee, as he is called.

    "I''m him, Hamfast Gamgee," he says, introducing himself. He appears prosperous
    and sports well-brushed feet and a twinkling eye. "Who are you? Why do you ask
    for Bag End? What brings you to our fair Shire?"

    Another Hobbit standing nearby whispers, "he looks like a Bounder to me."'
  - '"We must speak in private," you whisper, having learned a thing or two on your
    trip. "Please."

    You show him the silver dagger Strider gave you.

    Gamgee nods, impressed, and leads you to a private booth in the rear of the inn.'
