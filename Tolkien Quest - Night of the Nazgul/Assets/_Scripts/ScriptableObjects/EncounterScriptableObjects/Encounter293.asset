  - '"I believe you," he says, grim and shaken by your news. "I see the fire of truth
    in your eyes. Rest assured that I will warn Hobbiton, Bywater and Tuckborough
    -- if you have not already! The Farthing will know of this monstrous plot!

    Michel Delving shall hear of the coming of the Riders too, I promise you.'
  - 'You have done a great service, both to us Hobbits and to all beings who cheer
    the light of day."

    He pats you on the back and offers you his pipe. "Rest here for as long as you
    like, and put away your money!"

    You have succeeded where many might have failed! The Shire is safer because of
    your actions and courage.'
