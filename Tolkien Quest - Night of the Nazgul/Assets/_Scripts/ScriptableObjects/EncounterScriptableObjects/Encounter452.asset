  - 'Gildor leads you silently and quickly through the woods and thickets. When you
    reach a clearing, he stops and points.

    "Hobbiton lies three leagues in that direction," he says, pointing west and north.
    "Go now, and take this."

    He hands you to doses of a healing herb, Athelas.'
  - 'You ask for advice, but Gildor shakes his noble head.

    "Advice is a dangerous creature, young one. Too much is as bad as too little.
    Rely upon yourself, that is my advice."

    He disappears into the woods in the wink of an eye.

    <i>You are now in space 24F</i>'
