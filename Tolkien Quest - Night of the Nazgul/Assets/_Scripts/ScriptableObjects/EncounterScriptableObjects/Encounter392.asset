  encounterText:
  - 'The furious Hobbits knock you senseless. You partially regain consciousness as
    they tie your hands with rope.

    "Take him to my smial and lock him in the cellar!" one well-dressed Hobbit cries.'
  - 'They seize your belongings and carry you to a gathering of Hobbit-holes, ignoring
    your pleas for understanding.

    "I am on an urgent mission!" you cry as they shove you toward the round door of
    a large smial. "The Black Riders are coming!" you scream. "Strider sent me!"

    The procession halts at the door.'
