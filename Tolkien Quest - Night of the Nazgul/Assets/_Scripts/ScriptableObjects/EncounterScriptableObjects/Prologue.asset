  - 'You have just finished your evening chores in the stables of the Prancing Pony
    Inn when a middle-aged Hobbit approaches from the shadows.

    "Come with me, young friend," he whispers, a finger to his lips, "if you would
    help save the Shire."

    You want to ask questions -- <i>Who are you? What do you want? Why <b>me</b></i>?
    -- but he insists that you follow him silently.'
  - 'The Hobbit leads you on tiptoes through the courtyard of the three-storied inn
    and into the kitchen. You hear voices raised in song, and the merry sound heartens
    you, although the troubling mystery of your little mission lingers. You sneak
    by the surly cook and peek into the parlor before entering the smoky room, a log
    fire blazing in the hearth, and wait. The Hobbit points to a far corner of the
    room.

    "Go and take a seat. Trust me."

    Puzzled but concerned, you follow the hairy-footed fellow''s advice.'
  - Familiar faces fill the room. Long-bearded Dwarves gather on one bench near the
    fire, a husky bunch of Bree-landers drink ale in a corner, and a trio of Hobbits
    trade tall tales on stools near the door. At first you think they are the only
    folk in the room. Then your eyes adjust to the dim, grey light and you see several
    strangers sitting alone, some of them looking at you.
  - '"Finished your chores?" Barliman Butterbur inquires from behind you.

    You turn to face the stocky, bald man and nod.

    "Then run along! Don''t scare off the customers with that look of yours!"

    You turn and enter the parlor, taking a seat by yourself in one corner of the
    room.

'
  - 'Suddenly a heavy hand falls on your shoulder. You look up and see a tall stranger
    wearing a rough cloak and muddy leather boots.

    "Come. Let''s talk."

    Something in the man''s speech leads you to trust him.'
  - 'The lean, clean-shaven stranger motions you to an empty bench near the fire and
    asks if you''ll have some refreshment. Thirsty but a bit frightened, you shake
    your head.

    "I sent for you because I am told you can be trusted to undertake a journey of
    the utmost importance," he says confidentially. "The mission is dangerous and
    you must not fail. The very existence of the Shire may be at stake. Will you accept
    this burden, to do or die?"'
  - '"I will."

    The ease with which the words escape your mouth surprises even you.

    The stranger relaxes, stretching his long legs before him.

    "Good!"

    From his cloak he produces a long-stemmed pipe and a pouch of pipeweed. Lighting
    the pipe with a glowing twig from the fire, he puffs and surveys the room, the
    distinctive odor of nicotiana filling the air.'
  - '"I am an old friend of the Hobbits of the Shire, who along with others call me
    Strider. I am a Ranger; the woods are my home."

    Wide-eyed, you nod, having heard tales of the wood-wise and good Rangers.

    Strider leans forward to speak confidentially.'
  - "\"Young friend, Black Riders are abroad. Have you heard of them? They were once
    great men whose lust for power enslaved them. They are now very powerful and deeply
    evil spirits, nine in number. They threaten the very existence of the Shire. That
    is why I have called for \nyou.\"\nYou feel your heart pounding in your chest
    -- is it from excitement or fear?"
  - 'Strider goes on, taking a moment to glance around the room.

    "You have a quick mind and a brave heart, I am told. You will need both. What
    you must do is leave tomorrow at daybreak to warn the Shire of the coming of the
    Dark Riders. The Hobbits must prepare themselves for the worst. I would go myself
    but I must wait here for the arrival of a very important visitor."'
  - 'The Ranger pauses again, sizing up a bearded, swarthy stranger who slips into
    the seat near you and orders ale in a gruff, foreign voice before asking for Bill
    Ferny.

    "Foremost, ride to warn Hobbiton," Strider whispers, eyeing the man nearby, who
    has also lighted a pipe, with suspicion.'
  - '"Warn Buckland, the Marish, and the Bridge-fields if you can; let them know in
    all the Farthings of the Shire that the Riders are on their way. Do not worry
    about those good folk east of the Brandywine; Rangers are warning them even as
    we talk. Travel as far as you can, as fast as you can, however your wits will
    carry you. Find a messenger at Tuckborough who can be trusted to get the word
    to the Hobbits of Sackville and Michel Delving.'
  - '"You can trust the Shirriffs of each Farthing to help you, if you convince them
    to believe you. You will know the Shirriffs by the feathers in their caps. Leave
    at dawn -- there''s not another moment to waste. Here."

    He hands you a small scroll and a pouch; you begin to open it, but Strider stops
    you.'
  - '"Open the pouch in the privacy of your room, with the door bolted. You will find
    refreshment and nedicinal herbs inside. The scroll is a map of the area. Study
    it before you leave Bree. Take this!"

    He hands you a gleaming silver dagger in a sheath that hangs neatly from your
    belt.

'
  - '"It will protect you and tell my friends that you are indeed my messenger. Do
    not lose it! And remember: avoid crossing openly at the bridge -- a Black Rider
    watches it at all hours. You cannot match his power. Agents of the Dark Forces
    watch the main roads too, and the ferries both north and south. They may know
    of you already."'
  - 'As Strider pauses, again casting his steely gaze around the room, your blood
    runs cold: they''re after me already, you think.

    "Beware the roads and the woods," Strider goes on. "Bandits and evil things prowl
    them in search of the likes of you. Servants of Sauron have stirred up the beasts
    and beings in the region."'
  - '"Be on guard in the Barrow-downs; great treasure lies entombed there, in the
    heart of that haunted land, but grave danger lurks there also. If you take that
    path, cross the downs as quickly as you can. If possible, I will send a Ranger
    to watch over you part of the way. You will know him by the silver star on his
    cloak. Tom Bombadil in the Old Forest and Gildor''s Elves in the Green Hill Country
    may help you. But for the most part, you are on your own."'
  - 'You tuck the scroll inside your tunic, put the dagger and sheath on your belt,
    and tie the pouch to it.

    "There is one more matter," Strider adds in a whisper. "When you return to your
    quarters, look under your bed. You will see a large sack. Take from the sack only
    one weapon or take the chain mail; I can spare nothing else, and your journey
    requires that you travel light. Now go!" the Ranger urges you. "I will see that
    no one follows."'
  - 'You leave the haze and warmth of the Prancing Pony''s parlor tingling with excitement
    and exit into the cool, clear air of a starry night. You check the courtyard,
    seeing no one, and cross to the stables where your room is. Inside the stables
    the Hobbit courier waits for you.

    "Don''t fail us!" he pleads. "Be very careful; trust no man unknown to you."

    The Hobbit leaves without making a sound, disappearing into the shadows.'
  - 'Inside your room, you bolt the door, light a candle and quickly scan th emap.
    You see that your journey will take you twelve leagues west to the Brandywine
    River -- by the most direct route -- and another twelve to Hobbiton, if you make
    it that far in time. It seems impossible, but you must try!

    On the floor beneath your be lie an empty backpack and a bag. You untie the string
    and open it; inside you find a sword, a bow with ten arrows, a mace and a suit
    of light chain armor.'
