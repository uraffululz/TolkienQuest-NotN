  - 'You run through the woods, the gloom deepening around you. The sword grows heavy
    in your hand, so havy that you need both hands to carry it. You rush ahead down
    the path and come face-to-face with Gildor, a very tall, bery angry Elf.

    "Give me the sword, thief!" he demands, glowering at you.'
