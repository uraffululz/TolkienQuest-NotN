  encounterText:
  - 'The man wears muddy leather boots and a grey cloak, carries a sword, a bow, and
    a silver dagger at his side. He slows as he nears and calls out in a friendly
    way.

    "Hello there! no need to be afraid. Name is Pock. I''m just a roving minstrel."

    You see a lyre strapped to the man''s back. His long legs and leather boots catch
    your eye; he reminds you of Strider.

    "Let me offer you food and drink," he says. You watch as he reaches into his knapsack
    and produces a bottle and a loaf of bread. "The bread is no fresher than me, I''m
    afraid," he says with a hearty laugh.'
