  - 'The fragrant meadows of the bridgefields area revive your sagging spirits.

    A friendly Hobbit welcomes you into his kitchen and offers a meal of bacon and
    eggs.

    "Have you eaten five or six times today?" he asks

    You lead up to your mission; the fierce light in his eye leads you to believe
    you have an ally in this Halfling.'
