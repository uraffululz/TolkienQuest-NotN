  - 'Late that night as you lie in the small Hobbit bed trying to fall asleep, you
    wonder: is there another such mission I might undertake? Never have I felt so
    alive and important, you declare to the stars. I will do it again! I will! Your
    mission completed, the Shire warned of the coming of the Nazgul, you fall into
    a deep, restful sleep, dreaming of coming adventures and even greater challenges.

    <i>THE END</i>'
