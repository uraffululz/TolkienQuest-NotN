  encounterText:
  - You watch as the man rummages through tall stacks of papers. Finally, he seizes
    a parchment and reads it avidly. Without seeming to notice you, he walks to the
    far corner of the room and begins to dig at a stone in the wall about three feet
    up from the floor. You watch as he jabs at the dusty mortar and pries free the
    stone, which he drops on the floor with a thud.
  - From the wall he pulls out a small locked chest and sets it on the floor in front
    of him. He breaks the lock, opens the lid, and cries out with pleasure. You watch
    him juggle jewels, a necklace, two gleaming daggers encrusted with precious stones
    and a dozen silver pieces. Then he stands, fills the pouch at his waist with the
    booty, and walks toward the door you are hiding behind.
