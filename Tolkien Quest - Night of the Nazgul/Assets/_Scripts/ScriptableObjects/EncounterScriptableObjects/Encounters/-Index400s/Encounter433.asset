  - "<i>WELCOME TO WOODHALL</i>, the village sign reads. Located near the Woody End,
    this charming Hobbit town opens its arms to you. Word passes through the village
    that you have come to warn the Shire of a coming catastrophe; some say it is another
    Long Winter. Suddenly a tall (3-and-a-half-feet-tall!) Hobbit stands forth --
    a Took, he tells you --\n and bids them all be quiet.\n\"Let us say no more of
    this in the open!\" he commands."
