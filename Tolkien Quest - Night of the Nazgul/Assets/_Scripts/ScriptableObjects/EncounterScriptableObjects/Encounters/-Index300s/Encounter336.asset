  encounterText:
  - You tiptoe into the dark cave and peek around a turn in the passageway to see
    a Troll -- nine feet tall, wide as a house, a greenish brown creature with peeling,
    steely scales covering his skin -- trying on variously gleaming bracelets, apparently
    "humming" to himself.
  - 'Lying near you is a pile of arms -- shortswords, clubs, daggers; halfway between
    you and the Troll lies a pile of shiny booty, including jewels, necklaces, rings
    and earrings.

    You can guess only too well where their rightful owners must be now!'
