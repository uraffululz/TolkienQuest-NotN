  - 'You awake stunned and bleeding, the man tending to your wonunds.

    "You young fool, I might have killed you," he says kindly, shaking his head. He
    applies a salve to your wounds that instantly numbs the pain. From his knapsack
    he produces a bottle of what appears to be wine and asks you to stand, if you
    can.

    <i>Change your damage taken to equal one half of yourEndurance (round down).
