  - 'In a daze you follow a stone-bordered path over a knoll and see a two-storied
    housd built under the overhanging shoulder of a hill; falls bubble down beside
    it. (<i>You are in space 10G.</i>)

  - '<i>Hey! Come derry doil! Hop along, my hearty!

    Young adventurer, come, let''s have a party!

    Now let the fun begin! Let''s sing a song together!</i>

    An answering voice -- a woman''s -- sweet and clear as the water of the brook,
    but ancient as the hills replies:'
  - '<i>Now let the song begin! Let us sing together!

    Of sun, stars, moon and mist, rain and cloudy weather,

    Light on the budding leaf, dew on the feather,

    Wind on the open hill, bells on the ehather,

    Reeds by the shady pool, lillies on the water:

    Old Tom Bombadil and the River-daughter!</i>'
