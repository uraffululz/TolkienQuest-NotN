  encounterText:
  - After another song that lulls you into a peaceful mood, an Elf asks you to join
    them for a meal. With the overhanging boughs of tall trees acting as a roof, you
    enter the outdoor "dining hall" and join a small party of Elves seated on tree
    trunks, enjoying food and drink. You are served a nourishing light bread, berries
    that invigorate you and a cup full of a cool, golden liquid.
  - 'You rest briefly and stir, startled to find Gildor standing above you.

    "Even the gentle animals of these woods have been aroused by the Evil around us,"
    he says in a matter-of-fact way. "Come, you must leave now," he says, leading
    you toward the path.
