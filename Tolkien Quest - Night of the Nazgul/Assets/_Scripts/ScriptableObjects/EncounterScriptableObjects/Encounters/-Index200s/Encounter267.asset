  encounterText:
  - '"Hail, Rider!" you call to the figure draped in black. The rider pulls up and
    leans forward in the saddle, sniffing at you.

    "Where is Baggins?" he demands in an eerie, bodiless voice that sways you. You
    look puzzled and shrug. "Where is the Hobbit -- with the ring?"'
  - '"I don''t know," you reply honestly, chilled by the rider''s breath.

    "Liar! Fool!" he hisses, crying out. In an instant he pulls his sword and leaps
    off the horse at you.'
