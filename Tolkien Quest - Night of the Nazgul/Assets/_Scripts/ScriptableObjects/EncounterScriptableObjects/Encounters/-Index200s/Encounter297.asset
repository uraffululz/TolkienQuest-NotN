  - You struggle to keep up with the silent, quick-moving, long-legged Elves as they
    hasten down a grassy land in the woods. The path descends between two rolling
    hills, hazel crowding their slopes on either side. Ahead, the Elves leave the
    path and cut through thickets that tear at your eyes and clothe, yet they seem
    unmarred and unbothered. You huff and gasp for air to keep up as they bothered.
    You huff and gasp for air to keep up as they march up the slopes to the top of
    a hill above the river valley.
  - 'Suddenly trees open up on one side and you stand in a wide, grassy area; to the
    east, the ground falls off sharply and you see (above the sloping tree line) lowlands
    and in the distance, a small village quiet as a toy model.

    The Elves gather together to talk, seated comfortably on the grass their weapons
    on the ground behind them. <i>You are in space 22G</i>'
