  encounterText:
  - 'Through the mist and tangle of the forest you hear the hearty song of an unseen
    man approaching. A calm settles over you. As the voice gets louder, you hear:'
  - '<i>Old Tom Bombadil is a merry fellow,

    Bright blue his jacket is, and his boots are yellow.

    None has ever caught him yet, for Tom, he is the Master.

    His songs are stronger songs, and his feet are faster.</i>'
  - From the woods bounds a bearded man in big yellow boots; his bright blue jacket
    stands out in the sombre woods. He smiles at you. You greet the famous "Master
    of wood, water and hill" and ask him for his assistance, breathlessly explaining
    your mission. You feel dizzy and excited in Tom Bombadil's presence.
  - '"Slow down, young one," he tells you. "Follow Old Tom home for a meal and we''ll
    hear all you have to say."'
