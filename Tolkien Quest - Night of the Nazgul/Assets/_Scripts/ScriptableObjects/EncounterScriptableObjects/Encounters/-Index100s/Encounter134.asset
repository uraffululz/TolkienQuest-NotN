  encounterText:
  - You show your dagger to a well-dressed Hobbit with brushed, hairy feet and tell
    him of Strider and the coming of the Black Riders. He holds a finger to his lips
    and pulls you into the shadows between the blacksmith's and the bakery shops.
  - '"You are in grave danger," he says. "Be more discreet. I will warn all good folk
    in the area. Here, I can offer you only this. Now be off!" He hands you a small
    pipe and a leather pouch. You start to protest, saying you don''t smoke, but he
    hurries you off.'
