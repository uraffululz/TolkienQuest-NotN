  encounterText:
  - You hear the faint sounds of footsteps coming closer. You steel yourself for the
    worst. Then you see the small, curly-haired, round head of a middle-aged man looking
    down at you.
  - '"Hullo!" he cries. "Quite a mess you''re in, quite a mess! Here!" Without your
    asking, he tosses down a rope. You pull yourself up and help the man -- who calls
    himself Bill Tobbas -- untie the other end of the rope.'
  - '"I travel the Greenway, selling my wares," he says proudly. "I''m a foolish old
    man but I cannot mend my ways. I can, however, mend pots!" He leads you to his
    wagon, which is overflowing with pots, pans, and tools. "I''m a peddlar; what
    do you do?" You explain that you need to get to the Shire with all haste.'
  - '"Well, I''m sorry but I cannot take you across the Barrow-downs," he explains.
    "I''m much too cowardly for that, though it is the fastest way. But I can offer
    you some advice: be more careful!" That said, he climbs aboard the rickety wagon
    and rides off. You get your bearings.'
