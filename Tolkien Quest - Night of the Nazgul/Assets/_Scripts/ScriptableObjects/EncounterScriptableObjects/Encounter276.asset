  encounterText:
  - 'Suddenly light strreams into the tomb; you must be dreaming this. There stands
    a funny man in a feathered hat, wearing a bright blue jacket and yellow boots,
    his hands on his hips. Removing his hat, the man approaches you, singing:'
  - '<i>Get out, you old Wight! Vanish in the sunlight!

    Shrivel like the cold mist, like the winds to wailing,

    Out into the barren lands far beyond the mountains!

    Come never here again! Leave your barrow empty!

    Lost and forgotten be, darker than the darkness,

    Where gates stand forever shut, till the world is mended!</i>'
  - With a cry and a crash, the Wight disappears. The man unties you -- identifying
    himself as Merry Old Tom -- and leads you into the sunlight. As he leaves, bounding
    off like a deer, you thank him.
