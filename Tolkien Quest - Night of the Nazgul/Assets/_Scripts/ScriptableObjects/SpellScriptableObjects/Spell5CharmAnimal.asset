  fullSpellDescriptionFromBook: You may cast this spell against any hostile normal
    'animal' (bear, wolf, snake, etc.). The animal will follow you (recored its OB,
    DB, and Endurance) and will fight any foe you desire it to. After it has fought
    once (one 'fight') for you, the animal will leave. You may only have one animal
    'charmed' at a time.
